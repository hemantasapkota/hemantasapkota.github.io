This is the "Hello world" post of [Hadron](https://github.com/hadronjs/hadron), a Node.js blogging platform, minimalist
 and extensible. I'm going to keep this post **because I love Hadron**, beside the fact that *this post is cool*. 

### Reasons I like Hadron

* Uses javascript and [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
* Rides the hype of [LevelDB](https://github.com/rvagg/node-levelup)
* Installs a nice "Hello World" sample post

But you can't only love something, right? It's always "Hate and love" as [Catullus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catullus) says:
> Odi et amo. Quare id faciam, fortasse requiris.

> Nescio. Sed fieri sentio et excrucior.

so beside this proving that the editor can handle latin, it makes you notice how boring "Lorem ipsum" is, and it makes you feel you need to be more creative the next time you create a sample text, so at least somebody will read it.

### Reasons I don't like Hadron

1. It's complicated
1. It was created by an Italian
1. It has the arrogance to say "I'm a publishing platfom"

## But the cherry on the cake...

Is that it consider code a first class citizen! So it gives color to the poor lines, statements and variables in a code block

```javascript 
function me_poor_outside() { 
  console.log("but AWESOME inside"); 
} 
``` 

And if you that far arrived </br>
to drop you need a comment , </br>
and I will take it as a present.
