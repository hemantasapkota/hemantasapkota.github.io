At startup the [Scatter service](https://github.com/mariocasciaro/scatter/wiki/Guide#services) `app_start` will be executed. A sample of such a service can be found in the file `app/entryPoint.js`. \n\nNot too exciting for now, but let's start to build our app.\n\n## Adding particles\n\nLet's add a new particle to our app. Particles are drop-in components, it means **you don't need to initialize or require** them in your code in order to activate them. It's the magic of having an IoC container!\n\nLet's add an express server to our application\n\n```\nnpm install particles-express\n```\n\nThat's it, yes really, not kidding. No custom executable to run, no code to write, just installing an `npm` package. Now you just  fire up your app again and see what happens\n\n```\nnode app\n```\n\nTry to access [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) to check what your new server have to say.\n\n## Using the services of a particle\n\nOf course our express server is not that useful as it is right? Let's register a new route in our app internal particle. Create a new file `app/controllers/HelloController.js` and drop in this code:\n\n```javascript\nvar self = module.exports = {\n    helloWorld: function(req, res) {\n        res.send('200', 'My first controller works!');\n    },\n\n    setup: function(express) {\n      self.log.info(\"Initialize my first controller...\");\n      express.get(\"/hello\", self.helloWorld);\n    }\n};\nmodule.exports.__module = {\n    properties: {\n        log: \"controllers/log\"\n    },\n    provides: 'controllers/setup'\n};\n```\n\nRestart your server and look at [http://localhost:3000/hello](http://localhost:3000/hello)\n\nA couple of things to notice here:\n\n* The `log` object (a core Particles service) is injected into our module by the IoC container. Almost any module can be injected and **shared across all the particles of your app!**\n* To register a new route, a new service was exposed, called `setup`. This service is invoked by `particles-express` to register new routes. Yes, that's right, particles can communicate with each other not only by using DI, but also by invoking services across all the particles of your app.\n\n## Working with assets\n\n...coming soon\n\n## Feedback & Social\n\nFollow [@particlesjs](https://twitter.com/particlesjs) on Twitter for updates.\n\nAlso there is a Google group you can use to ask questions and discuss about Particles. \nVisit the Hadron [Particles Google group](http://groups.google.com/d/forum/particlesjs).\n\n## Credits\n\n* [Mario Casciaro](https://github.com/mariocasciaro) - Twitter [@mariocasciaro](https://twitter.com/mariocasciaro) - Creator/Maintainer\n* Zbigniew Mrowinski - Twitter [@MrowinskiZ](https://twitter.com/MrowinskiZ) - Particles logo\n\n",
