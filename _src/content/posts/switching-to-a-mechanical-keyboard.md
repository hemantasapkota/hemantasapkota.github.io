Writing codes on the in-built keyboard for Macbook Pro, it turns out, is not
a good idea for your fingers, especially if you write code all day.
Switching to a mechanical keyboard was the right thing to do.

So What are **mechanical keyboards** ? I'll quote from the
[Tactile Keyboards Group](https://plus.google.com/communities/107279217898209966798)
founded by the legendary [Eric Raymond](https://plus.google.com/+EricRaymond/posts).

*What makes them better than a modern soft-touch keyboard?
The fundamental reason is ergonomic. Mechanical keyboards
(and especially buckling-spring keyboards) provide clear tactile feedback
that a keypress has taken place a handful of milliseconds before the key would
actually bottom out.  This feedback makes it possible for the typist to stop
pushing before the key bottoms out, reducing total effort by up to a (measured)
factor of two.*

I wanted to get the CODE 87-Key Mechanical Keyboard - Cherry MX Green ![Img](http://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/uploads/2013/08/6a0120a85dcdae970b01901f0872ad970b-800wi.jpg)
but the shipping to Australia is too damm expensive. $165 + $60 shipping.

Instead, I got the Steel Series gaming mechanical keyboard from Jb-Hifi, priced
at $125.

### So What's the verdict ? ###
Mechanical keyboard are absolutely great. I just feel dumb not knowing about
them earlier. I'm now typing longer, faster and better.

Getting used to it took about a week, and to make the process fun I used this
[Typing.io](http://typing.io).
