The other day I took a few skills tests for Java, Node.JS and IOS Development on [ODesk](http://www.odesk.com), and was surprisingly happy with the results. Although, I admit I could've done better with IOS because I took all the tests on the same day.

You can take retests on Odesk after a month of taking the original one. It's been a while since I have worked on real IOS project that utlises the core IOS SDK.

I'm also looking forward to getting up to the speed with IOS 7 SDK updates. Looks like http://ios7.codeschool.com/ is perfect for this.
