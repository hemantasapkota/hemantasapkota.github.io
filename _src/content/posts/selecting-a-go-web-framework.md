When GO came out in 2009, I had looked into it briefly. At the time, I didn't have much experience writing web servers or concurrent systems,
therefore, couldn't fully put into perspective the different features Go had introduced.

Fast forward around April 2014, after having extensive experience working on Javascript and Node.JS, I picked up GO again. 
I even attended GoLang Sydney Meetup ThoughtWorks.

Go is likely to be a number one choice for writing servers in the coming years.
