When GO came out in 2009, I had looked into it briefly. At the time, I didn't have much experience writing web servers or concurrent systems,
therefore, couldn't fully put in perspective the different features Go had introduced.

Fast forward around April 2014, I picked up GO again. I even attended GoLang Sydney Meetup ThoughtWorks.

After having done extensive Javascript and Node.JS, I have begun to fully appreciate the Go.
