The book maybe about Grunt, but its biggest value proposition, IMHO, is the
excellent walkthrough on the Node.js ecosystem and modern web development.

The author has very cleverly leveraged Grunt as a medium to introduce more
advanced tools like Coffeescript, Jade, Stylus, all of which when used
properly results in a huge productivity boost. See Chapter 4 Grunt in Action.

The only thing that I felt missing was a chapter on Javascript itself.
A brief intro on Javascript and its idiosyncrasies could have served as a nice
appendix. Although, the book does contain a good reference list on Javascript.

Who will benefit from the book ? Not including the usual front-end developers
and framework creators:

  * Experienced Java developers like myself who've made the move to the dynamic
world of Javascript (front-end/backend)

  * Web developers proficient in JQuery/PHP but have failed to get onboard the
Node train

All in all, there's no doubt that the book will serve as a handy reference for
Javascript developers
